I've been working on getting this site together to collect my coding and writing projects. It's not something that is going to be updated regularly, but should serve as a repository for what I am working on and who I am supporting. I wanted to have a little more control over my layout and get a better feel for CSS and such, so this site is a bit of a project itself. 

Please enjoy and I hope to post more soon!
